**Fast, Automated Feature Engineering and Selection using Polars!**

`featurewiz_polars` is a high-performance Python library designed to accelerate your machine learning workflows by automatically creating and selecting the best features from your dataset. It leverages the speed and memory efficiency of the [Polars](https://www.pola.rs/) DataFrame library.

## ‚ú® Quick Start

Get started in minutes! Here's a minimal example to create some mock data:

```python
import polars as pl

# Create a sample Polars DataFrame
data = {
    'col1': [1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 1, 6],
    'col2': [10.0, 11.5, 10.0, 12.5, 13.0, 14.5, 10.0, 15.0],
    'category': ['A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'A', 'C'],
    'target': [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
}
df = pl.DataFrame(data)
```

Or you can load a CSV file into `polars` library's dataframes for use with `featurewiz-polars`. Use this code snippet exclusively for `featurewiz-polars` pipelines.

```python
# Load a CSV file into Polars DataFrames using:

import polars as pl
df = pl.read_csv(datapath+filename, null_values=['NULL','NA'], try_parse_dates=True,
    infer_schema_length=10000, ignore_errors=True)

# Before we do feature selection we always need to make sure we split the data #######
target = 'target'
predictors = [x for x in df.columns if x not in [target]]

X = df[predictors]
y = df[target] 

# BEWARE WHEN USING SCIKIT-LEARN `train_test_split` WITH POLARS DATA FRAMES!
# If you perform train-test split using sklearn it will give different train test rows each time
# X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Instead you must split using polars_train_test_split with seed parameter 
# This will ensure your train-test splits are same each time to get same rows of data

from featurewiz_polars import polars_train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = polars_train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

Once you have performed train_test_split on your Polars dataframe, you can initialize featurewiz_polars and perform feature engineering and selection:

```python
from featurewiz_polars import FeatureWiz

# Initialize FeatureWiz for classification
wiz = FeatureWiz(model_type="Classification", estimator=None,
        corr_limit=0.7, category_encoders='onehot', classic=True, verbose=0)

# Fit and transform the training data
X_transformed, y_transformed = wiz.fit_transform(X_train, y_train)

# Transform the test data
X_test_transformed = wiz.transform(X_test)

# Transform the test target variable
y_test_transformed = wiz.y_encoder.transform(y_test)
```

Now you can display the selected features and use them further in your model training pipelines:
```python
# View results
print("Selected Features:")
print(wiz.selected_features)
# Example Output: ['col1', 'col2', 'category_A', 'category_B']

print("\nTransformed DataFrame head:")
print(X_transformed.head())
# Example Output: Polars DataFrame with only the selected features
```

## ü§î Why Use featurewiz_polars?
While there are many tools for feature manipulation, featurewiz_polars offers a unique combination of speed, automation, and specific algorithms:

**Vs. Original featurewiz (Pandas):**

**Speed & Memory:** Built entirely on Polars, `featurewiz_polars` offers exceptional speed and memory efficiency. It is particularly well-suited for handling datasets that exceed the limits of Pandas, leveraging Polars' multi-threaded processing and highly optimized Rust-based backend for superior performance.

### üöÄ Why Choose featurewiz_polars?

**Modern Backend:** Harnesses the power of the cutting-edge Polars ecosystem for unparalleled speed and efficiency.

**Vs. scikit-learn Preprocessing/Selection:**

- **Seamless Automation:** Combines feature engineering (e.g., interactions, group-by features) and feature selection into a single, streamlined pipeline. Unlike scikit-learn, which often requires manual configuration of multiple transformers, `featurewiz_polars` simplifies the process.
- **SULOV Algorithm:** Features the "Searching for Uncorrelated List of Variables" (SULOV) method‚Äîa fast, effective approach to identifying a diverse set of predictive features. This often results in simpler, more robust models. While scikit-learn offers methods like RFE, SelectKBest, and L1-based selection, SULOV is a unique advantage.
- **Integrated Workflow:** Transforms raw data into a model-ready feature set with minimal effort, making it ideal for end-to-end machine learning pipelines.

**When to Use featurewiz_polars:**

- **Handle Large Datasets:** Designed for maximum performance on datasets that push the limits of traditional tools.
- **Automate Feature Engineering:** Save time with automated creation and selection of impactful features.
- **Leverage Advanced Techniques:** Unlock the power of SULOV and other specialized algorithms for superior feature selection.

With `featurewiz_polars`, you get speed, simplicity, and cutting-edge techniques‚Äîall in one package.
